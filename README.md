Simple Varnish Buster
=====================

## WordPress plugin for simple, lightweight Varnish cache busting

Simple Varnish Buster is a WordPress plugin that ensures that when you update some content on your WordPress site, it 'busts' through the layer of Varnish caching so that visitors will immediately see the new content as soon as you've clicked 'Publish'.

## Foolish Assumptions

 * Your Varnish server is running locally, by default. If it is not, you will need to change this in Settings.

The plugin is available under the [GNU General Public License version 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), or (at your option), any later version.
